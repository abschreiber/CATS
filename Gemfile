gem 'carrierwave'

gem 'mini_magick', '~> 3.7.0'
# To create thumbnails of the images (and provide smaller assets for different views), we need to create different image files. CarrierWave doesn’t do this directly, but provides access to two systems that do, RMagick and MiniMagick. For CarrierWave, MiniMagick is recommended, so we’ll use that. This does require a system library named imagemagick which is a Linux-based interface for working with image files. First, let’s install imagemagick with homebrew.

gem 'devise', '~> 3.2.4'
#  we’ll be using the devise gem to manage user authentication for us

gem 'gravtastic', '~> 3.2.6'
# A nice addition to showing user names is to use an avatar. For our application, we can use the service that Gravatar provides. This service matches user email addresses with an avatar picture of their choosing, with several default images for those who have not yet configured an image.
# If you don’t already have a Gravatar account, head over and set one up.
# We can use the gravtastic gem to make this quite easy. In your Gemfile add the following dependency (under devise).
